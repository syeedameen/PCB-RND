librnd 2.3.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This version or librnd focuses on separation from its origins, pcb-rnd. Beside
a lot of smallish fixes and build system upgrades, the main step is the script
plugin relocation from pcb-rnd to librnd. This means the dozen-language
scripting of pcb-rnd is now available in any librnd app. This includes the
live script dialog as well.
