1. dependencies:
    - ansi/c89 compiler
    - make

2. configuration: none

3. compilation: none
   This lib is implemented as header files and needs to be #included in
   the host application. Either in the only one compilation unit that is using
   it or if there are multiple users, using a dummy .c file producing a
   separate object file. Types are set up before the #include, so precompiling
   a static lib is not possible. 

4. installation: none
   The project is small enough that it should be just copied into the host
   application source tree.
